StweetMap is a GoogleMap / Twitter mashup that is written entirely using the Google Web Toolkit.
The code is packaged up as an Eclipse project using the GWT plugin. You can run the code on your computer, or you can upload it to Google App Engine. 
There is a hosted version running at http://stweetmap.appspot.com/
